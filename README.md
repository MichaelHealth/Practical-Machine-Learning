Below is the code I used when creating the model, estimating the out-of-sample error, and making predictions. I also include a description of each step of the process.

Data Preparation
I load the caret package, and read in the training and testing data:

library(caret)
## Loading required package: lattice
## Loading required package: ggplot2
ptrain <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
ptest <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
Because I want to be able to estimate the out-of-sample error, I randomly split the full training data (ptrain) into a smaller training set (ptrain1) and a validation set (ptrain2):

set.seed(10)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=ptrain$classe, p=0.7, list=F)
ptrain1 <- ptrain[inTrain, ]
ptrain2 <- ptrain[-inTrain, ]
I am now going to reduce the number of features by removing variables with nearly zero variance, variables that are almost always NA, and variables that donâ€™t make intuitive sense for prediction. Note that I decide which ones to remove by analyzing ptrain1, and perform the identica
