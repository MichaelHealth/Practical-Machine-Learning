Practical Machine Learning Project
Introduction
The data for this project comes form 6 participants in a study who perform weightlifting exercises with accelerometers on the 


For this project, we are given data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 research study participants. Our training data consists of accelerometer data and a label identifying the quality of the activity the participant was doing. Our testing data consists of accelerometer data without the identifying label. Our goal is to predict the labels for the test set observations.
The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.
